# Deep Learning Project Assignments

All the Projects are completed as a part of Guided Assignment in which specific instructions to complete the tasks are given already. All these Projects are part of my Learning Course Deep Learning Specialisation on Coursera.

### 1.. -->  Classifying Cat vs Non Cat Images  <--
In this project a basic neural netwoek is created wich identefies the given image is of cat or not. It's implemented as a single node output Neural net. Input is fed into the form of Image vector which is genrated by flattening the image matrix/array. Values of the vector are nothing but image pixels which act as a feature for our neural net in classfication process.
